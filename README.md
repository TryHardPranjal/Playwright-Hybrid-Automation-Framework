## Architecture

The framework follows a layered design:

```text
                    Playwright Hybrid Automation Framework

                           Tests / Specs Layer
                                      ↓
                             Service Layer
                                      ↓
                            Page Object Layer
                                      ↓
                           API Utility Layer
                                      ↓
                        Playwright Core Engine
                                      ↓
                Browser | API | MockAPI | Environment
```

### What Each Layer Does

- **Tests**: contain scenario flow and assertions
- **Services**: contain reusable business operations
- **Pages**: contain locators and page-level actions
- **Utils**: contain logging, random data, retry, and helper utilities
- **Config**: manages environments, URLs, and environment loading
- **API Utils**: manage reusable request/response handling

### Generated at Runtime

These folders and files are created during test runs and should not be committed:

```text
.auth/
allure-results/
allure-report/
playwright-report/
test-results/
setup-page.png
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm
- Git
- Optional: Java 21 for local Allure CLI usage

---

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TryHardPranjal/Playwright-Hybrid-Automation-Framework.git
cd Playwright-Hybrid-Automation-Framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

If you only want the supported browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

---

## Configuration

### Local `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```env
REQRES_API_KEY=your_reqres_api_key
REQRES_EMAIL=eve.holt@reqres.in
REQRES_PASSWORD=cityslicka
MOCKAPI_BASE_URL=https://6a02e16f0d92f63dd25460eb.mockapi.io
PST_EMAIL=your_practice_testing_email
PST_PASSWORD=your_practice_testing_password
```

### Environment Files

The framework supports environment-based configuration through:

- `config/environments/dev.env`
- `config/environments/qa.env`
- `config/environments/stage.env`
- `config/environments/prod.env`

These are selected using `TEST_ENV`.

### GitHub Actions Configuration

Use Repository Variables for non-sensitive URLs:

- `WEB_URL`
- `API_URL`
- `MOCKAPI_BASE_URL`

Use Repository Secrets for credentials and tokens:

- `REQRES_API_KEY`
- `REQRES_EMAIL`
- `REQRES_PASSWORD`
- `PST_EMAIL`
- `PST_PASSWORD`

---

The hosted report is used to review:

- pass/fail summary
- test history
- failure screenshots and traces
- API request/response details
- execution trends
- CI/CD results

---

## CI/CD Workflow

```text
Push to main
        ↓
Install Dependencies
        ↓
Generate Auth State
        ↓
Run Chromium UI + Hybrid Tests
        ↓
Run API Tests
        ↓
Generate Allure Report
        ↓
Upload Debug Artifacts
        ↓
Deploy Latest Report to GitHub Pages
```
The GitHub Actions workflow is located at:

```text
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
```

### Workflow Highlights

- runs on push to `main`
- supports manual execution via `workflow_dispatch`
- allows environment selection
- allows browser selection for manual runs
- caches npm dependencies
- caches Playwright browsers
- runs Chromium UI + hybrid tests on push
- runs API tests on push
- uploads Playwright artifacts
- generates Allure report even when tests fail
- publishes Allure report to GitHub Pages

### Manual Workflow Inputs

When starting the workflow manually, you can choose:

- `environment`: `dev`, `qa`, `stage`, `prod`
- `suite`: `all`, `smoke`, `api`, `regression`, `e2e`
- `browser`: `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `crossbrowser`

---

## Authentication Strategy

This framework uses a stable authentication approach for the public demo site.

### How It Works

- API login is used to generate auth data
- auth data is stored in `.auth/user.json`
- browser tests reuse this storage state
- this keeps tests stable across local runs and CI

### Why This Approach

The public demo application can be affected by browser protection, rate limits, or account resets. Using API-auth-backed storage state is more reliable than depending on repeated UI logins for every run.

---

## Design Principles

This framework follows a few core principles:

- one responsibility per page object
- reusable business actions in services
- centralized locators inside pages
- dynamic data instead of hardcoded values
- strong separation of UI, API, and hybrid tests
- local and CI-friendly execution
- readable logging for debugging

---

## Adding New Tests

### UI Test

Add a new spec under:

```text
tests/ui/
```

Use the existing page and service layer instead of placing locators directly in the spec.

### API Test

Add a new spec under:

```text
tests/api/
```

Use the reusable API client and auth helper where applicable.

### Hybrid Test

Add a new spec under:

```text
tests/hybrid/
```

Use hybrid tests when a UI action must be validated with network-level assertions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Installation Issues

Reinstall browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

### Clear Generated Artifacts

```bash
npm run clean
```

### Open Last HTML Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Common CI Issues

- missing GitHub Secrets or Variables
- wrong environment selection
- stale auth state
- browser-specific timing differences
- API rate limits or account resets on public demo apps

---
